We know from experience it's unruly to have all of our functions in the same file and scope.  In this lesson we're going to cover how to group functions and define a specialized map known as a struct in order to organize our code more efficiently.

## Modules

Modules allow us to organize functions into a namespace. In addition to grouping functions, they allow us to define named and private functions which we covered in the [functions lesson](../functions/).

Let's look at a basic example:

``` elixir
defmodule Example do
  def greeting(name) do
    "Hello #{name}."
  end
end

iex> Example.greeting "Sean"
"Hello Sean."
```

It is possible to nest modules in Elixir, allowing you to further namespace your functionality:

```elixir
defmodule Example.Greetings do
  def morning(name) do
    "Good morning #{name}."
  end

  def evening(name) do
    "Good night #{name}."
  end
end

iex> Example.Greetings.morning "Sean"
"Good morning Sean."
```

### Module Attributes

Module attributes are most commonly used as constants in Elixir.  Let's look at a simple example:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  @greeting "Hello"

  def greeting(name) do
    ~s(#{@greeting} #{name}.)
  end
end
```

It is important to note there are reserved attributes in Elixir.  The three most common are:

+ `moduledoc` — Documents the current module.
+ `doc` — Documentation for functions and macros.
+ `behaviour` — Use an OTP or user-defined behaviour.

## Structs

Structs are special maps with a defined set of keys and default values.  A struct must be defined within a module, which it takes its name from.  It is common for a struct to be the only thing defined within a module.

To define a struct we use `defstruct` along with a keyword list of fields and default values:

```elixir
defmodule Example.User do
  defstruct name: "Sean", roles: []
end
```

Let's create some structs:

```elixir
iex> %Example.User{}
%Example.User{name: "Sean", roles: []}

iex> %Example.User{name: "Steve"}
%Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: []}

iex> %Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
%Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
```

We can update our struct just like we would a map:

```elixir
iex> steve = %Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
%Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
iex> sean = %{steve | name: "Sean"}
%Example.User{name: "Sean", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
```

Most importantly, you can match structs against maps:

```elixir
iex> %{name: "Sean"} = sean
%Example.User{name: "Sean", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
```

## Composition

Now that we know how to create modules and structs let's learn how to add existing functionality to them via composition.  Elixir provides us with a variety of different ways to interact with other modules.

### `alias`

Allows us to alias module names; used quite frequently in Elixir code:

```elixir
defmodule Sayings.Greetings do
  def basic(name), do: "Hi, #{name}"
end

defmodule Example do
  alias Sayings.Greetings

  def greeting(name), do: Greetings.basic(name)
end

# Without alias

defmodule Example do
  def greeting(name), do: Sayings.Greetings.basic(name)
end
```

If there's a conflict between two aliases or we just wish to alias to a different name entirely, we can use the `:as` option:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  alias Sayings.Greetings, as: Hi

  def print_message(name), do: Hi.basic(name)
end
```

It's even possible to alias multiple modules at once:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  alias Sayings.{Greetings, Farewells}
end
```

### `import`

If we want to import functions and macros rather than aliasing the module we can use `import/`:

```elixir
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
** (CompileError) iex:9: undefined function last/1
iex> import List
nil
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
3
```

#### Filtering

By default all functions and macros are imported but we can filter them using the `:only` and `:except` options.

To import specific functions and macros, we must provide the name/arity pairs to `:only` and `:except`.  Let's start by importing only the `last/1` function:

```elixir
iex> import List, only: [last: 1]
iex> first([1, 2, 3])
** (CompileError) iex:13: undefined function first/1
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
3
```

If we import everything except `last/1` and try the same functions as before:

```elixir
iex> import List, except: [last: 1]
nil
iex> first([1, 2, 3])
1
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
** (CompileError) iex:3: undefined function last/1
```

In addition to the name/arity pairs there are two special atoms, `:functions` and `:macros`, which import only functions and macros respectively:

```elixir
import List, only: :functions
import List, only: :macros
```

### `require`

Although used less frequently `require/2` is nonetheless important.  Requiring a module ensures that it is compiled and loaded.  This is most useful when we need to access a module's macros:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  require SuperMacros

  SuperMacros.do_stuff
end
```

If we attempt to call a macro that is not yet loaded Elixir will raise an error.

### `use`

The use macro invokes a special macro, called `__using__/1`, from the specified module. Here’s an example:

```elixir
# lib/use_import_require/use_me.ex
defmodule UseImportRequire.UseMe do
  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      def use_test do
        IO.puts "use_test"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

and we add this line to UseImportRequire:

```elixir
use UseImportRequire.UseMe
```

Using UseImportRequire.UseMe defines a use_test/0 function through invocation of the `__using__/1` macro.

This is all that use does. However, it is common for the `__using__` macro to in turn call alias, require, or import. This in turn will create aliases or imports in the using module. This allows the module being used to define a policy for how its functions and macros should be referenced. This can be quite flexible in that `__using__/1` may set up references to other modules, especially submodules.

The Phoenix framework makes use of use and `__using__/1` to cut down on the need for repetitive alias and import calls in user defined modules.

Here’s an nice and short example from the Ecto.Migration module:

```elixir
defmacro __using__(_) do
  quote location: :keep do
    import Ecto.Migration
    @disable_ddl_transaction false
    @before_compile Ecto.Migration
  end
end
```

The `Ecto.Migration.__using__/1` macro includes an import call so that when you `use Ecto.Migration` you also `import Ecto.Migration`. It also sets up a module property which we will assume controls Ecto’s behavior.

To recap: the use macro simply invokes the `__using__/1` macro of the specified module. To really understand what that does you need to read the `__using__/1` macro.

**Note**: `quote`, `alias`, `use`, `require` are a macro used when we work with [metaprogramming](../../advanced/metaprogramming).
